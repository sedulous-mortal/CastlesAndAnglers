# CastlesAndAnglers
A CLI game that is currently in Python 3 and text-based but may change a lot over time.

To get started playing, you can execute the following commands:

1) Open the CMD (in Windows) or Terminal (in MacOS)
2) Navigate to a folder such as Desktop, where you'd like to install the game, using the ```cd``` command, e.g. ```cd ~/Desktop```
4) Use the ```mkdir``` command, e.g. ```mkdir CnA``` and ```cd CnA```
5) Execute ```git clone https://github.com/sedulous-mortal/CastlesAndAnglers.git``` once you're in the folder you want to install into
6) Execute ```dir``` on Windows or ```ls``` on MacOS to make sure you can see the new folder created by the cloning action
7) ```cd CastlesAndAnglers/```
8) Inside, you will now see 2 folders (by executing ```ls```)
9) These are NOT both required to run in order to actually use this program, only the backend folder is required to run. The front end is a work in progress.
10) ```cd castles-and-anglers-backend```
11) Now, if you have VS Code fully configured, including the "code" command set up to run from your bash/shell, you should be able to just run ```code .``` in order to see the code for the backend folder opened up in VS Code.
12) You will notice there is a README in that folder that you can peruse. Go forth and rule!
